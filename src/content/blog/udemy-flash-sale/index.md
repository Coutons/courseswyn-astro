## The Secret: Udemy is "Always" on Sale

If you see a course priced at $199.99, **DO NOT BUY IT.**

Udemy runs sales almost every week. The comprehensive "list price" is rarely what smart shoppers pay.

## Major Sale Events (2026 Predictions)

*   **New Year Sale:** January 1 - 10
*   **Valentine's Sale:** February 10 - 14
*   **End of Month Flash Sales:** Usually the last 3 days of every month.
*   **Back to School:** August/September
*   **Black Friday / Cyber Monday:** November (The biggest prices drops of the year).

## How to Trigger a Sale "Manually"

If there is no site-wide sale, you can often trigger a discount for yourself:

1.  **Incognito Mode:** Open the course page in a private window. New users almost always get the $12.99 new student price.
2.  **Clear Cookies:** Clearing your browser cookies can reset the pricing algorithm.
3.  **Instructor Coupons:** Check the instructor's website or social media. They always have "Best Price" coupons active because they earn 97% revenue on those sales (vs 37% on organic Udemy sales).

## Conclusion

Patience pays off. If a course isn't $10-$15 right now, just wait a few days. Or better yet, check [CoursesWyn](/coupon/) for a 100% OFF coupon.
