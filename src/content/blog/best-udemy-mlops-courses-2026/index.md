If you've been sitting on the MLOps learning fence, 2026 is the year to jump off it. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/mlops-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Glassdoor reports the average MLOps engineer salary hitting $161,317 per year in the US</a>, with top performers clearing well above $200K. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.peopleinai.com/blog/the-job-market-for-mlops-engineers-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LinkedIn data shows MLOps has seen 9.8× growth in just five years</a> — making it one of the fastest-moving careers in all of tech.

The problem? Most machine learning professionals know how to build models, but very few know how to actually run them in production. That gap — between notebook experiments and live, monitored, scalable systems — is exactly what MLOps closes. And Udemy has become one of the most affordable places to close that gap fast — especially when you grab courses through [Udemy Coupon Code](/udemy-coupon-code) deals.

We put in the hours reviewing the Udemy MLOps catalog this **February 2026**, filtering for courses that are freshly updated, project-heavy, and taught by instructors who've actually shipped ML systems. Here are the eight that made the cut.

---

## What Is MLOps and Why Does It Matter in 2026?

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of bringing DevOps discipline — automation, versioning, monitoring, CI/CD — into the machine learning lifecycle. Without MLOps, most ML projects stall out after the model training phase. With it, teams can deploy, monitor, retrain, and scale models reliably in production.

The <a href="https://eliterecruitments.com/the-rise-of-mlops-jobs-global-hiring-trends-and-future-outlook/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MLOps market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2022 to $5.9 billion by 2027 at a 41% CAGR</a>. Companies aren't just hiring data scientists anymore — they want engineers who can operationalize AI at scale, handle model drift, build reproducible pipelines, and integrate ML into cloud infrastructure.

MLOps sits right at the intersection of three booming disciplines: machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps automation. If you're already working in any of those areas, pivoting toward MLOps is arguably the highest-ROI career move you can make this year. And if you're curious about how AI agents fit into modern MLOps pipelines, the <a href="https://medium.com/@coursewyn/the-best-udemy-courses-on-agentic-ai-and-ai-agents-for-2026-hands-on-guide-89050f72c0b6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best Udemy courses on Agentic AI for 2026</a> are worth checking out alongside this list.

## How We Selected These Courses

Before recommending anything, we applied strict filters across the entire Udemy MLOps catalog. This list was last verified and updated **February 2026**:

- **Rating:** ≥ 4.0 stars with a minimum of 500 student enrollments
- **Freshness:** Updated within the last 4 months, with new content on LLMOps, advanced monitoring, and modern tooling
- **Content depth:** At least 70% of course hours dedicated to MLOps and production deployment — not just introductory ML theory
- **Hands-on projects:** Real CI/CD pipelines, cloud deployments, or end-to-end ML workflows included
- **Instructor quality:** Active Q&A support and verifiable production experience
- **Price:** Available at steep discount during Udemy sales, regularly under $20

Eight courses met all criteria. Here's the full breakdown.

---

## MLOps vs LLMOps in 2026: What Changed?

Traditional MLOps focused on deploying static models (regression, classification) with tools like SageMaker and Kubeflow. In 2026, the majority of production AI work involves Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic systems.

LLMOps adds new challenges:
- Prompt drift & versioning
- Token cost optimization
- Agent orchestration (LangGraph, CrewAI)
- RAG pipeline monitoring
- Tools: LangSmith, Phoenix, TruLens, Helicone, LiteLLM

The best courses on this list now include LLMOps coverage (#4 & #6), while traditional MLOps courses (#1, #2, #8) remain essential foundations.

This one lands at the top of our list for a reason. Abhishek Veeramalla doesn't teach MLOps like a textbook — he teaches it the way it actually works inside engineering teams. You start with the ML lifecycle basics, but the course moves quickly toward the production challenges that actually matter: data and model versioning with DVC, experiment tracking with MLflow, containerizing models with Docker, and orchestrating workloads on Kubernetes using KServe.

What sets this course apart is the AWS integration. You get real hands-on time with Amazon SageMaker and Kubeflow — the tools enterprise teams are running right now. Every concept ties back to a real workflow rather than a hypothetical diagram, which is exactly what you need if you're planning to transition from a DevOps role into MLOps.

If you've worked with Docker and Kubernetes before, you'll find this course moves at a satisfying pace. If you're newer to the infrastructure side, the explanations are clear enough that you'll keep up without frustration. For those also exploring AWS AI services in depth, the <a href="https://medium.com/@coursewyn/best-aws-ai-courses-on-udemy-2026-aif-c01-bedrock-genai-developer-d0bfb6580e34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best AWS AI courses on Udemy for 2026</a> make an excellent companion to this one.

### 2. Ultimate DevOps to MLOps Bootcamp — Gourav J. Shah

**Best for:** Bridging DevOps and MLOps with a real end-to-end CI/CD project.

<a id="course.6565297" href="https://trk.udemy.com/c/6564357/3227798/39854?prodsku=course.6565297&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdevops-to-mlops-bootcamp&intsrc=PUI2_26324" target="_top"><img src="https://i.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/6565297_6f61_3.jpg" alt="Ultimate DevOps to MLOps Bootcamp Course" width="750" height="422"/></a>

This bootcamp takes a single project — predicting house prices using a regression model — and uses it as the vehicle for teaching everything from Docker setup and MLflow experiment tracking to GitHub Actions CI pipelines, Kubernetes inference infrastructure, and GitOps-based continuous delivery with ArgoCD.

That single-project approach is the course's biggest strength. Instead of context-switching between different examples, you always know where you are in the workflow. By the time you've deployed your model behind Seldon Core and set up Prometheus/Grafana monitoring dashboards, the entire MLOps pipeline clicks into place as a unified system rather than a pile of disconnected tools.

Gourav also covers the handoff workflows between data science, ML engineering, and DevOps teams — context that most courses skip entirely but that matters enormously inside a real organization.

**What you'll learn:**
- End-to-end ML pipelines following MLOps best practices
- MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning
- Model packaging with FastAPI and Docker
- GitHub Actions for automated CI pipelines
- Kubernetes inference infrastructure with KIND
- GitOps-based continuous delivery with ArgoCD
- Seldon Core for production model serving
- Prometheus and Grafana monitoring for live models

**Who this is for:** DevOps engineers breaking into MLOps, platform engineers supporting ML teams, cloud engineers wanting to understand production ML workflows.

**Enrollment:** 18,000+ students | **Rating:** 4.6/5 | **Duration:** 12+ hours | **Sale Price:** $16.99

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are these Udemy MLOps courses updated for 2026?

Yes. All eight courses were verified in **February 2026** to confirm recent updates. They include current content on LLMOps, cloud-native MLOps with AWS SageMaker and Kubernetes, GenAI integration, agentic AI workflows, and modern monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

### Do I need prior ML knowledge to take these courses?

It depends on the course. **#8 Deployment of ML Models** and **#5 Full-Stack AI Engineer** are both accessible with limited ML background. **#1 MLOps Zero to Hero**, **#2 Ultimate DevOps to MLOps Bootcamp**, and **#6 AI Engineer MLOps Track** work best if you already have basic ML or DevOps experience.

### How much do these courses cost?

During Udemy sales — which happen frequently throughout the year — all eight courses are available between $12.99 and $18.99.

### What MLOps tools do these courses cover?

Collectively, these eight courses cover the full modern MLOps stack: **MLflow**, **DVC**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **KServe**, **GitHub Actions**, **ArgoCD**, **Seldon Core**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **AWS SageMaker**, **Amazon Bedrock**, **Apache Airflow**, **FastAPI**, **Terraform**, and **Hugging Face**. Check the "What you'll learn" sections above to match specific tools to your needs.

### Will an MLOps course from Udemy help my career?

Absolutely — and the projects matter more than the certificate. A working CI/CD pipeline or a cloud-deployed ML model in your portfolio speaks far louder in technical interviews than any credential alone.

### How long will it take to finish one of these courses?

The courses on this list range from 10 to 51 hours of video content. At a pace of 1–2 hours per day with dedicated project time, expect to complete a 12–18 hour course in about 3–6 weeks. Krish Naik's 51-hour bootcamp is more realistically a 3–4 month journey at a sustainable pace.

### Is MLOps a good career path in 2026?

Without question. <a href="https://qubit-labs.com/tech-hiring-trends/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MLOps engineers rank among the most in-demand tech roles in 2026</a>, alongside AI/ML specialists and cloud engineers. The combination of ML knowledge with production engineering skills is genuinely rare — which is exactly why salaries remain strong and job listings consistently outpace available talent.

### How does LLMOps differ from traditional MLOps in 2026?

LLMOps focuses on prompt drift, token usage, agent orchestration, and tools like LangSmith/Phoenix, while traditional MLOps handles model versioning & scaling. Courses #4 and #6 cover LLMOps specifically.
