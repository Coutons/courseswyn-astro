## Why Give Away Your Course for Free?

It seems counterintuitive, but giving away free coupons is the single most effective marketing strategy for new Udemy courses.

**The "Social Proof" Engine:**
1.  **Students Enroll Free:** You distribute 1000 free coupons.
2.  **Enrollment Count Spikes:** Udemy's algorithm sees an influx of students.
3.  **Reviews Generate:** A percentage of these students leave 4-5 star reviews.
4.  **Organic Ranking:** Udemy promotes your course in search results because it now has "Social Proof" (students + ratings).
5.  **Paid Sales:** Regular users see your high-rated course and buy it at full price.

## Understanding Coupon Types

### 1. Free: Open (3 Days)
*   **Limit:** Unlimited redemptions (but rare now).
*   **Use Case:** Viral marketing blasts.

### 2. Free: Targeted (31 Days)
*   **Limit:** Custom redemption limit (e.g., 100 codes).
*   **Use Case:** Rewards for loyal followers or newsletter subscribers.

### 3. Best Price (31 Days)
*   **Price:** $9.99 - $12.99 (or local equivalent).
*   **Use Case:** The standard way to sell your course to your mailing list.

## Best Practices

*   **Don't spam:** Don't just dump links in Facebook groups.
*   **Engage:** Ask students for honest feedback.
*   **Update:** Keep your course fresh to maintain those high ratings.
*   **Submit to CoursesWyn:** We list high-quality free coupons to our audience of thousands of learners.

## Conclusion

Coupons are a marketing expense. You "pay" in free access to "buy" the visibility that leads to paid sales later.
