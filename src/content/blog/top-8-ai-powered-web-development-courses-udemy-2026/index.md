### 1. AI-Accelerated Web Developer Bootcamp | Build Full-Stack App (Jackson Kailath)

**Best for**: Gold standard full-stack Next.js with modern AI workflows

<a id="course.6526539" href="https://trk.udemy.com/c/6564357/3227798/39854?prodsku=course.6526539&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fgenerative-ai-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp-nextjs-react-app&intsrc=PUI2_26324" target="_top"><img src="https://i.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/6526539_a882_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""/></a>

Have you ever wanted to build a real-world web application but didn't know where to start? Or are you an experienced developer looking to modernize your workflow? Welcome to the AI-Accelerated Web Developer Bootcamp—the only course you need to go from zero to full-stack developer, the modern way.

Whether you have never written a single line of code or you’re a professional developer, this course is designed for you. We believe the best way to learn is by building, so we'll dive straight into creating a complete, professional application from the ground up.

In today's tech landscape, the way we build software has fundamentally changed. Engineers at top companies leverage the power of AI to build faster and smarter. This course teaches you this exact modern workflow. Our core philosophy is Just-in-Time Learning: you'll learn precisely what you need, right when you need it, and apply it immediately.

How We Learn (The "Senior Dev" Method):

This course is not about blindly copy-pasting code from an AI. We will use an LLM (like Gemini) as a powerful learning tool, mirroring the workflow of a senior developer:

1. Define the Goal: We'll break down a feature into a clear requirement.
2. Draft with AI: We'll craft a precise prompt to have an AI generate the first draft of our code.
3. Analyze & Understand: This is the most critical step. We will go line-by-line through the AI-generated code to understand the "what" and the "why".
4. Refine & Refactor: You will then take the lead—fixing bugs, making improvements, and integrating the code perfectly, just like a senior engineer would.

By the end of this course, you will not only have an incredible project for your portfolio but, more importantly, the confidence and skill to bring any of your own ideas to life.

**Key learning outcomes**:
- Use the Senior Dev method to learn to code
- Learn to Code with the help of an LLM, Get the first draft written, Read the code and understand the code and make modifications
- Next JS 15, React 19
- Typescript, Javascript, Tailwind 4
- Be able to use shadcn components, zod , Prisma

**Ideal students**:
- For Absolute Beginners (with Zero Coding Experience): If you're new to coding, this is the perfect place to start. Our dedicated "Foundations" module will gently guide you through the essentials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, giving you the solid groundwork needed to tackle the main project with confidence. You don't need any prior experience—just a desire to build!
- For Experienced Developers: If you're already a developer, this course will level up your skills. You will learn how to integrate a cutting-edge, AI-accelerated workflow and master the latest features of the modern web stack, including React 19, Next.js 15 Server Components, and advanced database management with Prisma.
- For All Learners: This course is perfect for anyone tired of fragmented tutorials who wants to build a single, comprehensive portfolio project and learn a practical, momentum-driven approach to development.

<a id="course.6916805" href="https://trk.udemy.com/c/6564357/3227798/39854?prodsku=course.6916805&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fai-dibe-coding-training&intsrc=PUI2_26324" target="_top"><img src="https://i.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/6916805_0d2b_8.jpg" border="0" alt=""/></a>

Make AI Coding Predictable, Reliable, and Genuinely Productive. AI tools can dramatically accelerate software development — but only if you use them in the right way. Most AI coding tutorials show magical demos: an app generated from one prompt, or a tool that seems to “just work.” In real engineering work, these examples rarely hold up. Projects are complex. Requirements shift. Codebases carry deep, implicit knowledge. If you rely on trial-and-error prompting, output becomes inconsistent, unpredictable, and hard to trust. This training fixes that. It is practical and applied: you’ll learn a step-by-step workflow you can immediately use in real codebases and real tasks — not theory, not hype, not academic abstractions. You’ll learn how to collaborate effectively with any AI coding tool — Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Theia IDE, and others — using a tool-agnostic workflow built for professional software development.

This structured approach is called the Dibe Coding methodology: a practical, repeatable process for getting consistent, high-quality results from AI. Built on real projects. Refined with enterprise engineering teams. Proven to work.

**Key learning outcomes**:
- Work effectively with any AI coding tool such as Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, Cline, Cursor, Windsurf, Theia IDE, etc.
- AI for professional software development on exiting code bases where quality matters and not just demos and proof-of-concepts are produced
- How to structure your AI coding workflow for consistent, high-quality results
- When and how to use techniques like context engineering and task engineering
- Practical follow-up actions to efficiently refine AI-generated code
- How teams can collaborate and share common AI workflows

**Ideal students**:
- Designed for software engineers, programmers, tech leads, and innovators who want to integrate AI into real-world development workflows — from those just beginning to explore AI-assisted coding to those seeking to optimize and scale it within their teams.

**Enrollment**: 59+ (New Releases)| **Rating**: 5/5 | **Duration**: 5.5 hours
