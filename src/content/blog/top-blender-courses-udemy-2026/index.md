## Top 8 Blender Courses

### 1. **Complete Blender Creator: 3D Modelling (Compatible with 4.3)** by GameDev.tv Team, Grant Abbitt

The most successful Blender course ever made — over 1 million students and still the #1 recommendation on Reddit r/blender in 2026. Updated October 2025 with 4+ hours of brand-new content specifically for Blender 4.5: full Geometry Nodes 4.5 mastery (procedural cities, forests, scatter systems), Eevee Next real-time rendering, redesigned asset browser workflow, adaptive subdivision system, Grease Pencil 3.0 line art integration.

You start with Blender 4.5's refreshed UI and viewport navigation, then dive into low-poly modeling: extruding chairs, loop cuts for swords, bevels for detail. Modifiers are taught in depth — Subdivision Surfaces for smooth curves, Array + Curve for modular dungeons, Boolean unions for complex props. UV unwrapping covers Smart Project/manual seams/Ucupaint, PBR texturing with Principled BSDF, normal maps, roughness, metallic, and baking for efficiency.

Major projects include a fully rigged low-poly dinosaur (armatures, weight painting, shape keys, Graph Editor walk cycles), a complete modular dungeon environment, and a spaceship exported to Unity/Unreal with LODs and animation baking. The sculpting section now uses Multires + 4.5’s new Cloth brush for organic detailing (cartoon heads with horns, ears, clothing). New 2-hour bonus module teaches how to sell assets on TurboSquid, Sketchfab, and Unity Asset Store — pricing, thumbnails, description templates.

Real 2025 student outcomes:
